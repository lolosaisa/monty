The Monty language
Monty 0.98 is a scripting language that is first compiled into Monty byte codes (Just like Python). It relies on a unique stack, with specific instructions to manipulate it. The goal of this project is to create an interpreter for Monty ByteCodes files

DATA STRUCTURES
In this repository i will be solving ALX tasks by applying the knowledge i have when it come to stacks and queues.
